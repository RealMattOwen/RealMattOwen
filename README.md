## Who I am
I'm Matt, a 23 year old JavaScript developer based in London, UK. I have over 3 years of professional experience as a developer, currently working at [Mindera UK](https://mindera.com) and have been focused on web development for over 5 years. I specialise in front-end development and have a passion for ensuring that [accessibility best practices](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility) are in place whenever possible. I'm also very passionate about helping and teaching others that are interested in code in any way that I can, as part of this over the past 5 years I've been helping people in online [Discord](https://discord.com/) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/) communities with any code questions and problems that they have had.

You can find me on Twitter [@RealMattOwen](https://twitter.com/RealMattOwen)

## What I do
Put simply, I work to create accessible and performant web applications. Some of the tech I use to help meet those goals:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
- [Reach UI](https://reach.tech/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- [LinguiJS](https://lingui.js.org/)

## Long term goal
I hope to one day be proficient enough to be able to use different forms of assistive tech and have knowledge on as many different kinds of disability as possible and know how to provide better user experences for each of them. From there I would aim to do consulting work for different companies across a range of different industries to be a part of making companies products more accessible for everyone.
